        Vikings is the modern name given to seafaring people originally from Scandinavia, who from the late 8th to the
        late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe. Itâ€™s easy to think of the
        Vikings simply as terrifying warriors but they also had regular baths and cleaned
        their ears using special spoons.

            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
			<p>
			    You might not think Vikings cared about their appearance but they did!
			    They really liked blonde hair and found a way to dye it.
			    There were no hairdressers back then and so they used soap with something called lye in it which would lighten
			    their hair.

                The Vikings were brilliant at making boats and ships.
                Their longboats could fit 60 people in at a time which was very impressive in those times.

                Old Norse was the language that Vikings used.
                In the Old Norse language Viking meant pirate raid!
